# Drippz-1

## Project Description
 A java based ORM for simplifying connecting to and from an SQL database without the need for SQL or connection management. 

## Technologies Used

* PostgreSQL - version 42.2.12  
* Java - version 8.0  
* HikariCP - version 3.4.5
* JUnit - version 4.12
* log4j - version 1.2.17
* Maven - version 1.8
* SonarCloud - for code monitoring

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development  
* Simple to use API.  
* No need to directly use SQL.
* Simple Annotation based for ease of use. (Primary Key is required)
* Methods for performing operations with the input of an annotated class or Object of that class depending on the function
* Create: Annotated Class
* Get: Annotated Class, List<String> of field names (e.g. "first_name" to get just the results from the collumn first_name)[A single entry in this list with an * will return all fields], LinkedHashMap<String, String> containing in the first string the field name to search by, and in the 2nd String the value to compare to (e.g. ("id", 20) for WHERE id = 20) [an empty LinkedHashMap<String, String> will return all results in the table] (Returns a ResultsSet containing all results)
* Insert: Object of Annotated Class (Returns DB Generated Primary Key in ResultSet)
* Update: Object of Annotated Class, List<String> of field names (Uses ID of Object to determine which row to edit)(Must Specify the name of the column in the table here) (Returns number of rows changed in Result Set if successful)

To-do list: [`for future iterations`]
* Implement Delete Data Function   
* Bridge Hikari's Logger to Log4j to resolve startup output
* Test Join Collumn Functionality
 



## Getting Started  
Currently project must be included as local dependency. to do so:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/210517-Enterprise/Drippz_1.git
  cd *your-repo*_p1
  mvn install
```
Next, place the following inside your project pom.xml file:
```XML
		<dependency>

			<groupId>com.drippz</groupId>
			<artifactId>drippz</artifactId>
			<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

		</dependency>

```

Finally, inside your project structure you need a drippz.props file in located src/main/resources/
 ``` 
  DB_URL=path/to/database
  username=username/of/database
  password=password/of/database  
  ```
  
## Usage  
  ### Annotating classes  
  All classes which represent objects in database must be annotated.
   - #### @Entity(entityName = "table_name")  
      - Indicates that this class is associated with table 'table_name'  
   - #### @Column(name = "column_name)  
      - Indicates that the Annotated field is a column in the table with the name 'column_name'   
   - #### @Id(ColumnName = "column_name") 
      - Indicates that the annotated field is the primary key for the table which will be generated by the DB and returned upon insertion.


  ### User API  
  
  - #### `Dripp drippObjectName = new Dripp();`  
     	- returns an object of the main class allowing access to the below methods
     	- each object of the class has it's own cache that is used automatically when retrieving data from the DB
	- holds a StringBuilder that holds the created SQL statement
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.beginTX();`  
     	- Returns Void
	- adds the opening of a transaction to the object's SQL statement
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.commit();`  
     	- Returns Void
	- adds the closing of a transaction to the object's SQL statement	
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.runTxUpdate();`  
     	- Returns Void
	- sends the statement currently held in the Dripp object to the Database
	- No return expected
	- Throws SQL Exception

  - #### `drippObjectName.runTxQuery();`
     	- Returns ResultSet
	- sends the statement currently held in the Dripp object to the Database
	- Expects a result
	- Throws SQL Exception
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.create(annotatedClass.class);`  
     	- Returns Void
	- Must be preceded by drippObjectName.beginTx(); and followed by drippObjectName.commit(); send with runTxUpdate()
	- adds a drop statement for a table of the name given in the annotatedClass and then adds a statement createing a table based on the fields in the annotated class
     	- All classes to be persisted must have the @Entity Tag and a defined entityName in the annotation which is extracted to be the table name
     	- All properties to be persisted must have the @Column Tag and a defined columnName in the annotation which is extracted to be the name of the columm	
 
  - #### `drippObjectName.get(annotatedClass.class, listOfTargetFields, linkedHashMapOfConstraints);`  
     	- Returns a ResultSet corresponding to the GET method being run with the list of target fields and the constraints provided
	- do not use with transaction send with runTxQuery();
	- adds a get statement to t
     	- All classes to be persisted must have the Entity Tag and a defined table name this name is extracted to target the GET
     	- A list of strings containing the DB column names to be returned (A single entry of "*" will return all columns)
     	- A LinkedHashMap containing the property name as a key and the value to search for as the value. Range searching is not implemented, only equals
	- Throws IllegalArgumentException or IllegalAccessException
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.insert(objectOfAnnotatedClass);`  
     	- Returns id in ResultSet
	- do not use with transaction send with runTxQuery();
	- Creates SQL statement to insert object into matching table
     	- id field will be filled by the database upon persistance, and will not be taken from object
     	- All annotated fields will be persisted to the database
	- Throws IllegalArgumentException or IllegalAccessException
	
  - #### `drippObjectName.modify(objectOfAnnotatedClass, List<String> targetFields);`  
     	- Returns number of collumns modified in resultset
	- do not use with transaction send with runTxQuery();
     	- id field will determine target row in database upon persistance
     	- All fields listed in List<String> targetFields will be updated to values in objectOfAnnotatedClass
	- Throws IllegalArgumentException or IllegalAccessException or NoSuchFieldException or SecurityException
